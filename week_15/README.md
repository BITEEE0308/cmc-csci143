# Coroutines and Async Programming in Python

<img src=blocking-calls.jpg width=400px />

### Background

The problem:

1. IO (Input/Output) is slow

    Examples:

    1. Reading a file

    1. Network access

1. Traditional IO operations "block" the CPU from doing work

    <img src=IOBound.webp height=200px />

Solution:

1. Asynchronous programming

    <img src=Asyncio.webp height=200px />

Techniques:

1. Threads

1. Callbacks

1. Promises

1. ... many more ...

We will use: Coroutines (i.e. `async` / `await` syntax)

1. Recall that "routine" is a synonym for "function"

    The "co" stands for "cooperative", and so "coroutines" are functions that cooperate with each other

1. Currently most popular technique

1. Computationally efficient

1. "Easy" to use compared to other techniques

History:

1. Syntax has changed considerably since first introduced in python,
    and only "stabalized" in Python 3.5 (2015)

    - Every python version since then has still introduced minor changes

Applications:

1. Web frameworks:

    1. WSGI - Web Server Gateway Interface (pronounced like Whiskey)

        [PEP333 - Python Web Server Gateway Interface v1.0](https://peps.python.org/pep-0333/) (2003)

        1. Django

        1. Flask

    1. ASGI - Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface

1. Database access:

    1. SqlAlechemy 1.4 (latest version) introduced [Beta support for async operations](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/asyncio.html)

    1. Psycopg3 [introduces async support](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/advanced/async.html#async)

        First stable release was this year

        By default, sqlalchemy still uses psycopg2 as the backend

        History of the name, [from the postgres mailing list](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CA%2BRjkXFL6Jy7actUy%2BS%3DdGfjpuD_jpUYYofGpON%2B1Nq9S2Y75w%40mail.gmail.com#f9771ec89bf350e0594cf9640a1f912c):

        > I wanted to call it psychopg but I typed the name wrong.  And the name just stuck.

**Takeaway:**

1. Async makes io code faster

1. Not everything is async yet, but everything will be async in the future

### Concurrent Web Requests

    1. Examples all use docker/postgres or (mongo or redis)

## Homework

Part 1: generator syntax practice (10pts)

1. Fork/fix the [containers repo](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/containers) so that all test cases pass

    Submit the completed repo to sakai

1. This is an assignment from CS46 (data structures), and so only students who didn't take that with me need to complete it

Part 2: wardial (20pts)

Both assignments will be due Wednesday, May 11.
