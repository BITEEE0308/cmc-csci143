## Lecture

1. The elements of a standard web service deployment
    1. Everyone uses Linux (or another unix flavor)
        1. [Even on Microsoft Azure, over 50% of all servers run Linux](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-developer-reveals-linux-is-now-more-used-on-azure-than-windows-server/)
    1. [12 factor webapp](https://12factor.net/)
        1. one of the most influential guides for high scalability
        1. written at a fairly high level, so sometimes a bit too vague for beginners
    1. Instagram's tech stack 
        1. We will closely follow instagram's tech stack
        1. <img width=80% src=webapp.png />
        1. detailed writeup from 2011: https://instagram-engineering.com/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of-technologies-adf2e22da2ad
            1. 3 nginx
            1. 25 django
            1. 1 pg\_bouncer
            1. 12 postgres
        1. more users => consume more resources => slower responses ; increase the numbers of each service above for faster responses
        1. hosted on AWS => "easy" to add more services
        1. does not use docker (it didn't exist)
            1. docker => even easier to add more services
            1. without docker, it's difficult to ensure that all instances are running the same code
            1. docker usage is seeing huge adoption right now: https://www.datadoghq.com/docker-adoption/
            1. major companies like netflix use docker: https://netflixtechblog.com/the-evolution-of-container-usage-at-netflix-3abfc096781b
            1. fundamental sys-admin principles you learn working with docker will transfer to whatever deployment solution your future employers use
            1. <img src=galaxy-brain.jpg width=50% />
    1. nginx
        1. load balancer
        1. manage TCP/IP state
        1. encrypt/decrypt HTTPS requests
    1. The web development framework defines the web page's "application logic"
        1. django
            1. this is what instagram uses
            1. the "first" python web framework
            1. "heavyweight" and "highly opinionated"
        1. flask
            1. this is what we'll be using
            1. currently the most popular python web framework
            1. "lightweight" and "unopinionated"
                1. easier to get started
                1. less boilerplate code
                1. usually faster
            1. didn't exist when instagram first started
        1. WSGI (pronounced like "whiskey")
            1. A standard interfance for python web frameworks
            1. Ensures that the rest of the tech stack doesn't care which framework you use for you application logic
            1. Internal to the framework libraries -> doesn't affect application developers
    1. [gunicorn webserver](https://gunicorn.org/)
        1. Converts a WSGI application into an actual web service that people can connect to
        1. Handles multiple requests simultaneously and in parallel (using the `fork` syscall)
        1. Much more efficient than flask's built-in webserver
    1. pg_bouncer + postgresql database
        1. Extremely complicated
        1. Most of this class will be focused on the database
        1. Instagram also uses other databases for parts of their website (memcached, redis, solr)
            1. We'll talk about the differences between postgresql and each of these throughout the course
        1. sqlalchemy python library for interacting with the database from the webapp

1. More docker containers
    1. docker volumes
    1. managing your space on the server
        1. Dockerfile and [overlay filesystems](https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/11/18/how-containers-work--overlayfs/)
    1. docker-compose
        1. credentials and git
    1. dependency management
        1. [51% of docker images have critical security flaws](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25454207)
    1. [Dockerfile best practices](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices.md)
    1. [Best simple docker reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-docker-can-help-you-become-a-more-effective-data-scientist-7fc048ef91d5)

1. More networking
    1. We often work with hostnames instead of IP addresses
        1. Hostnames can be defined locally in the file `/etc/hosts`
            1. My hosts file is set to https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/data/StevenBlack/hosts to block requests to ad/malware servers.
               (This blocks more requests than just an adblock extension for your browser.)
        1. Hostnames can be defined globally using DNS servers
        1. The hostname `localhost` always resolves to the IPv4 address `127.0.0.1`.
    1. Load balancing
    1. [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)
        1. 200: success
        1. 404: file not found
        1. 503: internal server error (problem in your python code)
            1. syntax errors cause the server to shutdown and it needs to be restarted

1. More unix shell
    1. exit codes and the `$?` variable ([optional reference](https://shapeshed.com/unix-exit-codes/))
        1. 0 = success
        1. 1-127 = failure
    1. the commands `true`, `false`, `test`, `[`
    1. if statements
    1. connecting programs with `|`, `&`, `||`, `&&`, `;` ([optional reference](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/24684/confusing-use-of-and-operators))

## Lab / Homework

<img src='Strip-Le-dÃ©ploiement-english650-final.jpg' width=80% />

Your lab and homework assignment this week are combined together.
The goal is for you to get a fully working web service using our modified instagram tech stack.
This is a slightly more complicated "hello world" than you did last week that includes (almost) all of the services we'll be using in this class.

1. Create a new git repo called `flask-on-docker`

1. Follow this tutorial to create the necessary files for a simple web app: https://testdriven.io/blog/dockerizing-flask-with-postgres-gunicorn-and-nginx/

1. Add all of your tutorial files to the `flask-on-docker` repo except your database credentials.

   **IMPORTANT:**
   Many security breaches are caused by developers uploading credentials into public git repositories.
   See [this post for examples](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25013756).
   If any of your production credentials are uploaded to github,
   you will receive a -2 on the assignment.
   This is not -2 points off your grade, this is a NEGATIVE TWO POINTS TOTAL...
   committing private credentials to a public repo would cause your company to lose potentially millions of dollars, and so is worse than doing nothing at all.
   I strongly recommend creating a `.gitignore` file to prevent this from happening on accident.

1. Upload the url of your repo to sakai.

   There are no specific test cases that you need to pass,
   just by uploading the files, you'll get full credit.
   Next week we'll be introducing test cases that combine docker with the github actions continuous integration.
